# Advent of Code 2024

[Advent 2024](https://adventofcode.com/)

My fourth year attempting the challenge, second year using Kotlin.
Last year I reached day 15, let's see how far I get this year.

This year I'm trying something new with using Gradle and unit tests to run the code instead.

## Start a new day

To start new day, run the DayGeneratorKt utils.

```bash
# Defaults to current day
./gradlew generateDay


./gradlew generateDay -Pargs=02
```
